## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Addressed the issue of changing dontrun to donttest
* Changed all print() to cat() with verbose option
* Added copyright field in DESCRIPTION clearly indicating which files use copied code

## Test environments
* local R installation (macOS), R 4.1.3
* macOS-latest (on GitHub Actions), (release)
* windows-latest (on GitHub Actions), (release)
* ubuntu-latest (on GitHub Actions), (release)
* ubuntu-latest (on GitHub Actions), (old release)
* ubuntu-latest (on GitHub Actions), (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse Dependencies
There are no reverse dependencies to check.

Note: This is the first submission. All tests listed under examples use "donttest" because the algorithm is (by design) computationally expensive (close to 1 minute).
